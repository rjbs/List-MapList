README for List::MapList

List::MapList provides methods to map a list through a list of transformations,
instead of just one. The transformations are not chained together on each
element; only one is used, alternating sequentially.

Here's a contrived example: given the transformations { $_ = 0 } and { $_ = 1
}, the list (1, 2, 3, "Good morning", undef) would become (0, 1, 0, 1, 0) or,
without cycling, (0, 1).;

(I use this code to process a part number in which each digit maps to a set of
product attributes.)
